My professor told us how successful people tend to utilize computers to achieve success and move up through the ranking. Needless to say this intrigued me as he continued to talk about the different psychological aspects of how each individual tends to use a computer and how some people use a computer to do harm to others personal information by exploiting them. This conversation sparked my interest in wanting to learn more material about software and how things are developed to make sure that the product is secure and of high quality.\r\n\r\nChange is constant in the IT industry and causes many people to have to learn new protocols at a vast rate. Programming languages change hands as one becomes a leading favorite amongst developers and companies who want to achieve greatness. Just like the ever changing languages, developers have to lean towards new development paths to produce high quality products. One path that has led to many development teams success is Agile Development.\r\n\r\n> Everyone on an agile team is a tester. Anyone can pick up testing tasks.\r\n> - Addison-Wesley\r\n\r\n\r\n## Principles to Success\r\nJust like with any team, to be successful the team needs to work well together and produce a great product. In Agile Development, the team works as a whole to focus on continually producing their best work and delivering the best possible product. As an Agile tester one is able to help the customer see the product the way they wish to see it even if they are not able to explain what exactly they want the product to accomplish. Keeping close with the customer allows for the team to receive and provide continuous feedback on the project at hand. This allows for the team to quickly run through code and tests to continue to push out prototypes for testing by the customer and management. These prototypes allow for the team to deliver value in small stages to test certain functionality and to have the customer get their hands on the product. Due to constantly engaging with the customer I will say an Agile Development approach is not for everyone but it can pay dividends in ensuring that the product is what the customer wants in the end and to have no surprises. \r\n\r\nCommunication is a very key factor to success when working on a team, Agile teams work well together by finding unique ways and opportunities to facilitate communication. Have a question about an issue and before you know it you have two or three other team members in your office to bounce ideas off of and to get their feedback on some things. Developers being brought into an Agile Development tend to worry about certain factors of coding and testing but fear not as Agile teams utilize automated test suites that help negate the learning curve for heavy duty testing. This does not negate the manual testing needed but when developers are able to come in and code some of their tests it still makes them less nervous about working on the team. \r\n\r\nWhen things get tough during development the team must always remember to do the simplest things that could possibly work in any situation. This does not necessarily mean it will always work out right away, but it must be simple to help get everyone on track. Practicing these simple tasks will help individuals and the team to continually improve as a whole as they try to do better work. Retrospectives are a way teams can speak about the different tasks they work on and discuss what is working and what is not exactly cutting it. Things continually change on a project, whether the requirements or time tables cause things to get thrown out to meet a deadline. This continuous change means the team has to respond to change quickly and pick up where things fell off. Once a team starts working well together they start to become good at self organizing as a whole creating a culture where everyone can enjoy testing and all the aspects of development that lead up to testing.\r\n\r\nAs an Agile tester always remember to focus on people, whether team members or others on the team, and help them to do their best work. As a team member one should feel safe to not take the blame for a failure during an iteration and on an agile team one does not feel this as the team as a whole helps take some of the blame and they go out and fix the issue to help the team continue to move forward. Being able to work on a team where everyone collaborates, where you are engaged in the project from start to finish, where business stakeholders work together with the development team, where the whole team takes responsibility for quality and testing is nothing but a testers paradise.\r\n\r\n> Don't bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors. Try to be better than yourself. \r\n> - William Faulkner\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\nAs your college career comes to an end, one can only hope to become a successful developer and land on a team that helps them to succeed. I can only hope that we all get the chance to experience the wonder of an agile development team. This essay is a way to remind myself of how to be a part of a successful team, most notably part of an Agile team. I hope this can lend a hand to others to help them carry a new mindset into their jobs they land after college or while in college. In summary, the ten principles all hold significant values in their own way. But if there is one principle to remember that is the more important than the rest, it is to enjoy what you do in life and to not question why you are where you are but to enjoy every aspect of what it is you are doing and to achieve success wherever life takes you. \r\n\r\nHope you survive in the real world :)\r\n\r\n> Imagination is more important than knowledge.
